# RS-Bot-Python
A custom Discord bot built on Python, supporting chat relay and other features for Minecraft Bukkit/Spigot servers.

Requires Python3 and the Discord.py library to run.
config.py must be filled in with proper values specific to your server. The Bukkit/Spigot server must also have a proper socket interface for the bot to connect to.

NOTE: This is not the current bot run on our server (https://redstone-server.info/). It was run for a couple years but has recently been rewritten in Java by one of our administrators due to changes in the Python Discord library.
